# Lets Find the Area & Circumference of a Circle
#Code by IAH (Infinity Aggarwal Harshul)
#Area of Circle Formula is (3.14*r*r) = (pi*radius of circle)
#Circumference of Circle Formula is (2*3.14*r) = (2*pi*radius of circle)

a = int(input("Enter Radius : "))                   #here we are taking user input value
b  = int(input("Enter Length : "))
print ("Area :",(3.14*a*a))                         #here print function will give output according to assigned opertors
print ("Circumference :",(2*3.14*a))

#Now the final output will according the formula mentioned below
