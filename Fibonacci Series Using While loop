# Lets Find the Fibonacci Series Using While Loop
# Code by IAH (Infinity Aggarwal Harshul)
# fibonacci series always start with 0,1 and then will be addition of first two numbers and it is 
# steadily increasing and series is {F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)} (you can replace n with a simply)


n = int(input("Enter the Number : "))
a = 0
b = 1
c = b
count = 1

while count <= n:
	print(c, end=" ")
	count += 1
	a,b = b,c
	c = a + b
print()                                    #here print function will give output according to assigned opertors

#Now the final output will show the fibonacci series
