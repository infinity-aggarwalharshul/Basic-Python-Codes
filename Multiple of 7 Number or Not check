#Code by IAH (Infinity Aggarwal Harshul)

a = int(input("Enter Number : "))   #taking user input and storing in the a variable
if (a%7==0) :                       #Taking if condition if the remainder is zero 
    print("Muliple of 7")            # then print it is multiple of 7
else  :                              # Taking else condition to decide if remainder is not zero 
    print("Not Mutiple of 7")        # then print not multiple of 7

#The output will be the final answer according to the statement that 
# whether user input number is multiple of 7 or not
