#Odd Number and Even Number Check Loop using for loop
#Code by IAH (Infinity Aggarwal Harshul)

n = int(input("Enter the number: "))  #lest take the input from user input value

for i in range(1,n+1):                          #while loop statment is executed every time when the variable is greater than or equal to user input value  
    if i % 2 == 0:                     #if the variable on division remanainder is equal to zero
        print(i,"Even Number")           #print even number
    else:                              #else if the variable on division remanainder is not equal to zero
        print(i,"Odd Number")            #print odd number
   # i += 1                             #for for loop we dont require this statemnet (increment by varialble by 1)
        
  # The ouput will be executed every time when user input value is taken and the variable on division remanainder is
  # equal to zero or not equal to zero then it will check that it is (even number or odd number)
