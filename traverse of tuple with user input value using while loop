#traverse of tuple with user input value using while loop
#code by IAH (Infinity Aggarwal Harshul)

x = int(input("Enter Number : "))   #here we take any user input value
a = (1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100)   #lets take an example tuple list
i = 0                               #lets initalize any variable equal to zero
while i < len(a) :                  # now in while loop we taken a condition if variable is less than length of tuple
    if (a[i] == x) :                # lets take one more condition if tuple at any index is equal to user input value
        print("Found At Inx : ",i)  # then print found
        break                       #break statement used to stop the execution( like a car break type) after founding the user input value in the example list
    else :                          #lets take else condition which will show if above statement is not true then find untill it reaches tuple length limit
        print("Finding : ",i)       # now simply print finding uptill value gets finded inside tuple 
    i += 1                          # increment it by 1
print ("end of loop")               #now after finding the value print end of loop

#The output will be finding user input value in example tuple and when value will be found 
#it will come out from loop and will stop the execution because of break statement used for it
# And if we enter any value outside the example tuple then will find and after reaching length 
#tuple it will end the loop
